## Project Purpose & Growth

I built this portfolio from scratch to improve my front-end skills and create a clean, minimal layout that reflects both my work and personality as a developer. I intentionally avoided using templates or UI frameworks to sharpen my understanding of responsive design, layout structuring, and CSS styling. I believe in using every opportunity as a chance to learn and grow, and this project was no exception. My goal was to keep things simple while highlighting the most important part, which is my projects.
Building everything from scratch required persistence and resourcefulness. I ran into challenges around visual design and UI, especially when translating my ideas into functional React components. After deploying the portfolio, I encountered unexpected rendering issues, which I successfully debugged and resolved. That experience gave me a deeper understanding of React and reinforced my ability to troubleshoot and learn independently — skills that have shaped how I approach every new project since.
